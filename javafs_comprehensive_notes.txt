Use C drive only to store the OS and the software
Use D drive only for your learning (projects and programs and material)
Use E drive for your personal (Movies, music, photos etc)

Download Git:
Google: Download git
Use the link: https://git-scm.com/downloads
Select the OS and download the installer file
Cut the installer file from the "downloads" folder and paste it inside C:/software/git folder
Now dowuble click and install it
Note that you must get the CLI/Command/App "git"
$ git --version (This is to check the version number of the CLI and also to check if the App is available)

Create a folder named "learning" in the drive D or E (which ever you use for learning purpose)

Inside learning, create the folders for all the technologies that you are learning

	javafs
	mongodb
D:/learning/javafs
